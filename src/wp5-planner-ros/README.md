# motion_planner

This package has for input the target informatin and for output the dynamical system for the motion planner


1) detect the target and extract the S shape in function of some parameters
2) create two phase motion planner:
  a) fill the corner of target
  b) fill the target
3) create a continuous dynamical system to be send to the robot



futur work:
1) Optimization to make the best path depending on some criteria
2) closed the loop with vision
